soma.js is a javascript model-view-controller (MVC) framework that is meant to help developers to write loosely-coupled applications to increase scalability and maintainability.

The main idea behind the MVC pattern is to separate the data (model), the user interface (view) and the logic of the application (controller). They must be independent and should not know about each other in order to increase the scalability of the application.

soma.js is providing tools to make the three parts "talk" to each other, keeping the view and the model free of framework code, using only native events that can be dispatched from either the framework or the DOM itself.
