Backbone.Marionette is a composite application library for Backbone.js that aims to simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript applications. It is a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in the applications that Derick Bailey has been building with Backbone, and includes various pieces inspired by composite application architectures, such as Microsoft's "Prism" framework.

This implementation of the application uses Marionette's module system. Variations using RequireJS and a more classic approach to JavaScript modules are also [available](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/wiki/Projects-and-websites-using-marionette).
