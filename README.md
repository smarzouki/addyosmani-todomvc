### This is the initial repo for TodoMVC - a rough idea for a new project.

	<p>Now more-so than ever, developers are interested in learning how to effectively apply the MVC architecture pattern to their JavaScript projects. The problem most devs experience when starting this process for the first time is trying to figure out <strong>which</strong> client-side MVC tool they should be using - <a href="">JavaScriptMVC<a>? <a href="">Backbone</a>? <a href="">Spine</a>? <a href="">Sammy</a>?. The list of solutions goes on. </p>
	<p>In addition to good documentation, libraries should ideally also be accompanied with a good set of <strong>examples</strong>. Some of them do a great job of this whilst others could use a little work. </p>
	
	<p>TodoMVC is a simple idea - the <strong>same</strong> sample application(s), built in each of the major JS MVC libraries so that you can easily find out how to:<ul>
		<li>Solve a common goal</li>
		<li>Learn how solutions approach achieving a goal differently</li>
		<li>Easily learn how to use the library in the process</li>
	</ul></p>
	
	<p>Where a project already offers a particular example, what TodoMVC does is ensure that there's consistency across cross-browser compatibility, features, UI and setup information.</p>
	
### Notes

I've previously tried setting up this repo as a stub pointing at a number of other repos as submodules. This idea worked in practice and would allow me to submit issues to be considered for inclusion on the original (indiv) todo repos, however because some of those (eg. my fork of the JMVC todo) have further submodules, I think it would be easier for now to include complete builds until we can get in place a more elegant solution.
