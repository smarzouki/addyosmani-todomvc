					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an <strong>MV* framework</strong> for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps. Backbone, Spine, Ember, JavaScriptMVC... the list of new and stable solutions goes on and on, but just how do you <strong>decide</strong> on which to use in a sea of so many options?</p>
					<p>To help solve this problem, we created <a href="http://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc">TodoMVC</a> - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks of today.</p>
					<p>Solutions look and feel the same, have a common simple feature-set and make it <strong>easy</strong> for you to compare the syntax and structure of different frameworks so you can select the one you feel the most comfortable with.</p>

					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
					<p>You can get setup with TodoMVC in just a few short steps:</p>
					<p>
						<ol class="vertical-space">
							<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/zipball/master">latest release</a>.</li>
							<li>Run TodoMVC on a local server (using <a href="http://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a>, <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a> or another suitable setup). You can then select an app to run using the 'Live demos' link to the left.</li>
							<li>Browse through the Todo apps, examine their source and discover which framework you might feel the most comfortable working with.</li>

					<h2>Selecting a Framework</h2>
					<p>Once you've downloaded the latest release and played around with the apps, you'll want to decide on a specific framework to try out.</p>
					<p>Study the syntax required for defining models, views and (where applicable) controllers and classes in the frameworks you're interested in and try your hand at editing the code to see how it feels using it first-hand.</p>
					<p>Please <strong>ensure</strong> that if you're happy with this, you do spend more time investigating the framework (including reading the official docs, the source and its complete feature list). There's often a lot more to a framework than what we present in our examples.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="span3">
					<h2>Labs</h2>
					<p>TodoMVC Labs showcases sample Todo applications for frameworks that have just been released or are still awaiting consideration for inclusion in <a href="http://todomvc.com">TodoMVC</a>.</p>
					<p>These implementations may not completely meet our specifications just yet, but are functional enough to provide developers with a preview of what they're capable of.</p>
					<p>While our team are working on improving these applications for a future release of TodoMVC, developers wishing to try out brand new frameworks or see what's coming next for this project can preview these applications today.</p>
					<p><em>An * indicates the application is using our latest template. Please note that all applications should be run on a local HTTP server unless we've said otherwise.</em></p>
