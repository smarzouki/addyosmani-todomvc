# Dojo TodoMVC app

## Notes

Developers often ask what the difference is between Dojo 1.7+ and Require.js, which also supports the use of [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules.

Require.js is a loader which implements AMD and may be used with various toolkits.There are some other AMD implementations like curl.js. 

Dojo is a toolkit which has been converted to use AMD and ships with an implementation of an AMD loader and optimization tools. As such, you do not need to use Require.js in order to write AMD modules using Dojo.
